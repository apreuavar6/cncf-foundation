## License exceptions

The manifest files in this directory contain a list of license exceptions that have been approved by the CNCF Governing Board. The exceptions are provided in JSON and SPDX tag-value format for convenience.

These manifests will be updated from time to time as new exceptions are approved.

Please see the [CNCF charter] and the [Whitelist Policy] for more background information.

## Whitelisted components

For convenience, the manifests also contain a list of certain other dependencies for which individual license exceptions were not required. This is either because (a) they were automatically approved as license exceptions under CNCF's [Whitelist Policy]; or (b) they are under Apache-2.0 and therefore aligned with the IP policy in the [CNCF charter]. 

Dependencies that are not currently listed in the manifests, but which satisfy (a) or (b) in the preceding paragraph, are automatically approved and do not need separate license exceptions.
