## Developer Representation on the CNCF GB Policy v1.0

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is a community made up of developers, vendor companies and end user companies. The funding and marketing functions of CNCF are overseen by its Governing Board (GB) while technology decisions are under the purview of the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC).  The GB currently consists of company representatives (16 platinum seats, 1 gold seat and 3 silver seats) plus the chairperson of the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC).

The GB has approved a resolution to add two developer seats to increase the voice of developers on the GB. One of those seats will be filled by a member of the Kubernetes Steering Committee when its election concludes in early October. The other seat will be selected in an election by the maintainers of the other non-inception-level projects (i.e., currently 7 projects, as 2 are inception-level and Kubernetes is excluded from this seat).

The developer seats will be held for 2 years, except that the initial Kubernetes seat will only be appointed for 1 year, so as to stagger the terms of the 2 seats. 3 months prior to the Kubernetes seat coming up for renewal, this system of dedicating one seat to Kubernetes will be reviewed.

The GB meets every two to three months to approve resolutions and discuss CNCF administrative matters, or more frequently if urgent matters arise. Every meeting of the Governing Board must reach quorum in order to pass resolutions, so only people who can make themselves available on a recurring and consistent basis should consider running for a developer seat.

### Developer Seat Eligibility

Members of the Kubernetes Steering Committee are eligible to hold the Kubernetes seat. The Steering Committee will determine its own method for selecting the representative, though CNCF is happy to run an election for it if requested.

For the other seat, the pool of eligible nominees and voters are individuals who have commit privileges (also known as maintainers or as having the Github commit bit) in at least one non-sandbox-level, non-Kubernetes CNCF project at the time when nominations are called. The CNCF maintains a [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pr8cyp8RLrNGx9WBAgQvBzUUmqyOv69R7QAFKhacJEM/edit#gid=262035321) of project maintainers.

Individuals with commit privileges who already hold a Governing Board seat through a vendor relationship or by being TOC chair are eligible to vote but not to run. The 2 developer seats and the TOC chair are collectively known as Technical Community Representatives and are required to be from different companies. If more than one Technical Community Representative would be from the same company, either at the time of election or from a later job change, they will jointly decide who should step down, or if there is no agreement, random lots shall be drawn.

If a developer seat holder resigns or is forced to leave their seat, the seat will be re-appointed by the original method and for the remainder of the previous term.

Individuals may self-nominate. In other cases, the nominee must confirm their acceptance of the nomination prior to the start of the ballot.
